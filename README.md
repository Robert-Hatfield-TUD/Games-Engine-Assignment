# Games-Engine-Assignment
This repository is for the game engines assignment

For the assignment a basic overview for it is that I plan to make an audio responsive foreground with a background including a procedurally generated landscape or trees. In the foreground there will be a small ball which will be bouncing on the moving bars in accordance to how they react depending on the music which is playing.
