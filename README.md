# Games-Engine-Assignment
This repository is for the game engines assignment

For the assignment a basic overview for it is that I plan to make an audio responsive foreground with a background including a procedurally generated landscape or trees. In the foreground there will be a small ball which will be bouncing on the moving bars in accordance to how they react depending on the music which is playing.

The project will hace a procedurally genrated background, a foreground responsive to the input of audio and a small ball including a 3D character trapped in said ball bouncing on the moving foreground
